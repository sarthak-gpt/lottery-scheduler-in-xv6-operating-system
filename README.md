# Operating Systems cs 5348 class project 2 - Add Lottery Scheduler to xv6

Add a lottery scheduler to xv6
----------------------
In this project, you will replace the current round robin scheduler in xv6 with a lottery scheduler, which we discussed in the class and is also described in OSTEP book. The basic idea is simple: assign each running process a slice of the processor in proportion to the number of tickets it has. The more tickets a process has, the more it runs. Each time slice, a randomized lottery determines the winner of the lottery; that winning process is the one that runs for that time slice.
The objectives for this project:
 To gain further knowledge of a real kernel, xv6.
 To familiarize yourself with a scheduler.
 To change that scheduler to a new algorithm.
 To make a graph to show your project behaves appropriately.

Setting Tickets
----------------------
You need to implement a new system call to set the number of tickets. The prototype of the system call is:

int settickets(int)

This call sets the number of tickets of the calling process. By default, each process should get one ticket; calling this routine makes it such that a process can raise the number of tickets it receives, and thus receive a higher proportion of CPU cycles. This
routine should return 0 if successful, and -1 otherwise (if, for example, the caller passes in a number less than one).

Implementing Scheduler
----------------------
Most of the code for the scheduler can be found in proc.c; the associated header
file, proc.h is also quite useful to examine. (It is also very useful to read (relevant parts of) chapter 5 on Scheduling in xv6 book.)
To change the scheduler, first study its control flow. Find out the part of the code where round robin is implemented. Replace that code with your code for lottery scheduler.
 You will need to assign tickets to a process when it is created. Specifically, you will need to make sure a child process inherits the same number of tickets as its parent. Thus, if the parent has 10 tickets, and calls fork() to create a child process, the child should also get 10 tickets.
You will also need to figure out how to generate random numbers in the kernel. Some searching should lead you to a simple pseudo-random number generator, which you can then include in the kernel and use as appropriate.
 Getting Process Statistics
You need to implement a second system call to gather some statistics about all the running process. The prototype for the second system call is

int getpinfo(struct pstat *)

 This routine returns some information about all running processes, including how many times each has been chosen to run and the process ID of each. You can use this system call to build a variant of the command line program ps, which can then be called to see what is going on. The structure pstat is defined below. Note, you cannot change this structure, and must use it exactly as is. This routine should return 0 if successful, and -1
otherwise (if, for example, a bad or NULL pointer is passed into the kernel).
You need to understand how to fill in the structure pstat in the kernel and pass the results to user space. The structure should look like what you see below, in a file called pstat.h. You have to include this file in appropriate .c files.
 
#ifndef _PSTAT_H_
#define _PSTAT_H_

#include "param.h"
struct pstat {
int inuse[NPROC]; // whether this slot of the process table is in use (1 or 0) int tickets[NPROC]; // the number of tickets this process has
int pid[NPROC]; // the PID of each process
int ticks[NPROC]; // the number of ticks each process has accumulated
};
#endif // _PSTAT_H_

Good examples of how to pass arguments into the kernel are found in existing system calls. In particular, follow the path of read(), which will lead you to sys_read(), which will show you how to use argptr() (and related calls) to obtain a pointer that has been
passed into the kernel. Note how careful the kernel is with pointers passed from user space -- they are a security threat(!), and thus must be checked very carefully before usage.

Graph
-------------------
Beyond the usual code, you will have to make a graph for this assignment. The graph should show the number of time slices a set of three processes receives over time, where the processes have a 3:2:1 ratio of tickets (e.g., process A might have 30 tickets, process B 20, and process C 10). The graph is likely to be pretty boring, but should clearly show that your lottery scheduler works as desired.
